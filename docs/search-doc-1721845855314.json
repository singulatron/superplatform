Supported platforms: cuda Do not set this if your card doesn't support the given architecture or things will break. SINGULATRON_HOST_FOLDER​ This envar is needed when Singulatron runs as a container next to containers it starts: Host | |-&gt; Singulatron Container |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron To be able persist data, a host folder must be mounted by all containers. In our example (SINGULATRON_HOST_FOLDER=/var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_data) we basically pass down the full path of the singulatron-data volume we created in the docker compose file to the containers created by Singulatron. So cycle goes like this: Singulatron container writes to /root/.singulatron, which is mounted on host at /var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_dataAssets (which are basically downloaded files) will be passed to containers created by Singulatron by mounting files in /var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_data. SINGULATRON_LLM_HOST​ When Singulatron is running in a container, it needs to know how to address its siblings (other containers it started): Host | |-&gt; Singulatron Container |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron The Singulatron Container uses the envar SINGULATRON_LLM_HOST to address Container Launched By Singulatron. Typically this value should be 172.17.0.1 if you are using the default docker network. If you are using an other network than default, use docker network inspect to find out the IP of your docker bridge for that network. Usually it's going to be 172.18.0.1. This envar is not needed if Singulatron runs directly on the host: Host With Singulatron | |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron SINGULATRON_DB​ You can use this envar to make Singulatron actually use a database instead of local file storage to store data. PostgreSQL​ SINGULATRON_DB=postgres SINGULATRON_DB_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=&quot;postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase?sslmode=disable&quot; Naturally, you should change the details of the connection string to reflect your environment. SINGULARON_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH​ By default the local file storage will place files into ~/.singulatron/data, but this flag (and other config options) can override that.","keywords":"ai  llm  free gpt  gpt  open-source  open source  ai framework  ai server","version":"Next"},{"title":"Docker Compose","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/start/docker-compose","content":"Docker Compose This snippet will give you a quick idea about how to deploy the frontend and backend containers so they play nicely together: version: &quot;3.8&quot; volumes: singulatron-data: name: singulatron-data driver: local services: singulatron-frontend: image: crufter/singulatron-frontend:latest ports: - &quot;3901:80&quot; environment: # The `BACKEND_ADDRESS` must be accessible from the browser. # It is not an internal address, it's the address the browser will make API requests to. - BACKEND_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:58231 singulatron-backend: image: crufter/singulatron-backend:latest ports: - &quot;58231:58231&quot; volumes: # We mount the docker socket so the backend can start containers - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # We mount a volume so data will be persisted - singulatron-data:/root/.singulatron environment: # This folder will be mounted by the LLM containers to access the models - SINGULATRON_HOST_FOLDER=/var/lib/docker/volumes/ singulatron-data/_data # Address of the host so we can access the containers running the LLMs from the backend container # See &quot;System Specific Settings&quot; on this page for more information. - SINGULATRON_LLM_HOST=172.17.0.1 # # GPU Acceleration for NVIDIA GPUs # Uncomment this envar for NVIDIA GPUs. # # - SINGULATRON_GPU_PLATFORM=cuda Put the above into a file called docker-compose.yaml in a folder on your computer and run it with the following command: docker compose up Once it's running​ After the containers successfully start, you can go to 127.0.0.1:3901 and log in with the Default Credentials. Please keep in mind that this will store data locally on your machine in as gzipped JSON because Singulatron defaults to local file storage.
