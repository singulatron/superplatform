# Welcome to Superplatform

## What is it?

Superplatform enables you to self-host AI models, build apps that leverage those models in any language, and utilize a microservices-based communal backend designed to support a diverse range of projects.

## It lets you:

### Run AI Models [x]

Run open-source AI models privately on your own infrastructure, ensuring that your data and operations remain fully under your control.

### Quickly Build Backendless AI Apps [x]

### Develop Microservices-Based AI Applications [ ]

Superplatform itself is built on a microservices architecture. The platform's built-in services communicate with each other through the same APIs that you'll use to build apps on top of Superplatform.

### Deploy Third-Party AI Apps Easily [ ]
